# üñäÔ∏è Tidbit
A lightweight, dead-simple web-based text editor.
## Premise
Text editors nowadays are complicated. Really complicated. But writing is simple - words on a page tell a story. That's it.  
And the unnecessary abstraction, with differents fonts and headings and sizes and bold faces and italics, it feels like writing is a lot more complicated.  
So here's an editor that's built for the storytellers.  No fonts, no sizes, nothing. Just a title and a story. Just you.
## Implementation
Tidbit runs entirely in the browser, but because everthing is stored locally, you can download the files and run it on your dev server if you wish.  
```
! TIDBIT STORES TEXT IN LOCALSTORAGE. THAT MEANS IF YOU CLEAR YOUR CACHE, YOU LOSE YOUR WORK. MAKE SURE TO DOWNLOAD AS YOU GO.
```
## Exception
Yes, Tidbit is a minimal, bare-bones only editor. It's meant to be that way. There's one exception: sessions.  
Being able to write and edit more than one piece at once is important to me. So though an argument can easily and obviously be made that such a change both encourages a lack of focus on one objective while also complicating the tool, Tidbit will have sessions.  
That is the only exception.
